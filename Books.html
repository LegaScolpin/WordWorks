            <h2>Dark Diamonds</h2>
            <p class="indent">Merra Peters has lived in the darkness of her parent’s house her entire life. Never allowed to step foot in the daylight—for they feared the government was targeting their family. Merra knew something wasn’t right, and dreamed of the day when someone would come to her rescue.</p> 
            
            <p class="indent">When a young man breaks into Merra’s home, it’s not the escape she’d expected. He is nothing like the hero she imagined. He’s dark, cold, and demanding. Even when he offers her a new home in France, he expects her full undivided attention to break a curse that broke out hundreds of years ago. There is something about this young man that has Merra unexplainably entranced, but he may be the death of her before she can unravel his secrets.</p>

            <p class="indent">His cold, brown eyes bore into hers. “I will never treat you like a child. It does not matter how much you bat your eyes. It does not matter how much you cry and complain. It does not matter how tired or hungry you are. If there is work to be done, you do it. No questions asked. And if you fail, mommy and daddy won’t slap your hand and forgive you. I already helped you. My job is done. You must work hard to earn the chance to erase that failure. Understood?”</p>
            <p class="indent">
            Merra bowed her head. “Yes, sir.”
